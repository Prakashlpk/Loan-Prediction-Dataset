The Loan Prediction dataset includes various columns that represent the details of loan applicants and their financial information. The Loan_ID is a unique identifier for each loan application. The Gender column indicates the gender of the applicant (male or female). The Married column shows whether the applicant is married (Yes or No). The Dependents column indicates the number of dependents the applicant has, with values such as 0, 1, 2, or 3+. The Education column reflects the applicant’s educational background, indicating whether they are a Graduate or Not Graduate. Self_Employed tells whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes or No). The ApplicantIncome represents the monthly income of the applicant, while the CoapplicantIncome shows the income of the coapplicant, if any. The LoanAmount column shows the total loan amount requested by the applicant, in monetary units. Loan_Amount_Term refers to the number of months over which the loan will be repaid, such as 12, 24, or 36 months. Credit_History represents whether the applicant has a good credit history (1 for Yes, 0 for No). Property_Area indicates the type of area where the property is located, such as Urban, Semiurban, or Rural. Finally, the Loan_Status column is the target variable, indicating whether the loan was approved (Y for Yes, N for No).

The Loan_Status column, which indicates whether the loan was approved or not, is the target column and depends on the other features in the dataset. Because this dataset includes a target variable that depends on the features, it is a supervised dataset. Specifically, since Loan_Status is a categorical variable (with values Y or N), this dataset comes under categorical supervised learning, where the goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on the applicant’s financial details and other features.
